Notes from Active Record Videos

Objects do not know about SQL they know about methods.

belongs_to

to tell if there is a belongs to
you can look for the foreign key
ie a song belongs to an artist

http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#belongs-to-association-reference

In all of these methods, association is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument to belongs_to. For example, given the declaration:

class Book < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
end
Each instance of the Book model will have these methods:

author [association reader]
author= [association writer]
build_author
create_author
create_author!
reload_author



has_many
