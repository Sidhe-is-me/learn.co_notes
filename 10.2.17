Rack and how the internet works

Uh, Yeah I am unsure about what is going on in theses labs.
I understand that we are learning how to use local servers.

The path that is requested is the resource that the client wants. Since your server can contain a lot of functionality, the path signifies which specific part of your server it wants. If we were creating a simple shopping cart application, for example, we can think of a few different paths that are required:
Path	Description
/items	List all items available
/cart	List items in cart
How would we implement this in our Rack app? The path lives in the HTTP request, and to get to it we have to inspect the env part of our #call function. In the env variable is all of the information contained in the request. Thankfully, Rack has a great way of parsing all this information for us. It looks like this:

class Application

  def call(env)
    resp = Rack::Response.new
    req = Rack::Request.new(env)
    resp.finish
  end

end
