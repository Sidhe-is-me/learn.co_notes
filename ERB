What is ERB?

When we named the file .erb we were telling Sinatra that we’re creating an ERB file. ERB stands for Embedded Ruby – it’s a way of mixing plain text and Ruby together.

But it has different syntax than Ruby strings. By default, everything in an ERB file is assumed to be plain text that should be output to the browser.

Ruby Injection

But if we have some Ruby code that we want to run, we put in what’s called a ruby injection. Try this in your ERB file:

1
The SECRET NUMBER is <%= rand(100) %>
The <%= marks the beginning of Ruby code and the %> ends it. Sinatra will run the Ruby inside those markers and output the results in that spot.

Refresh your browser and you should see the number appear.

Passing Variables

But if you refresh your browser again the number will change. That’s no good – it means the random number is being regenerated each request.

Instead of generating the number in the ERB file, we want to take the number that was already generated in web_guesser.rb and pass it into the ERB template.

Change your ERB template to output a variable named number:


The SECRET NUMBER is <%= number %>
Then, in your web_guesser.rb, you need to pass the local variable into the ERB template like this:


erb :index, :locals => {:number => number}
Translated to English, this means "render the ERB template named index and create a local variable for the template named number which has the same value as the number variable from this server code."

Writing HTML

Our current output to the browser isn’t really valid HTML. The browser that we’re using is "repairing" it so that it can be displayed.

Let’s instead output valid HTML ourselves. Rewrite your template so it looks like this, which has the minimum valid HTML tags:

    <html>
     <head></head>
     <body>
       <p>
         The SECRET NUMBER is <%= number %>
       </p>
     </body>
    </html>
Refresh your browser and you should see … no change. But if you view the page source (different on each browser), you should see that full HTML structure.
