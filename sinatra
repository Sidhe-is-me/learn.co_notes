To start a Sinatra app :
  rackup app.rb
      (where app.rb is the name of your app) in the terminal

This should start up a server and then list the local
server you can look at your app
eg: localhost:9292
  Copy and paste that into your browser

when starting an app the code is read once on boot
and then never again.

cntrl + c
  will shut down the local serve
so that you can reload the code

In order to stop the tedious save stop and restart
in rack or Sinatra  we can use shotgun

shotgun
    type in terminal to start up app

    you should see  something like :
    == Shotgun/Thin on http://127.0.0.1:9393/
Thin web server (v1.6.4 codename Gob Bluth)
Maximum connections set to 1024
Listening on 127.0.0.1:9393, CTRL+C to stop

open up http://127.0.0.1:9393/

WHAT ARE ROUTES?
Every time a person clicks on a link, types in a URL, or submits a form, they are making HTTP requests to a specific URL on your application. Routes are the part of an application that connect HTTP requests to a specific method in your application code built to handle responding to such a request (that part of code is called a Controller Action).

In Sinatra, a route is constructed by pairing an HTTP method/verb, like GET or POST with a URL-matching pattern, i.e. a string that matches what users type in to their browser when they want to visit our webpage. We'll see an example in just a moment.
