Salt- a random string of characters that gets added into the hash so that no user has the same password.

bcrypt- an open source gem that encrypts users passwords

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_secure_password
end

In this case, the macro has_secure_password is being called just like a normal ruby method. It works in conjunction with a gem called bcrypt and gives us all of those abilities in a secure way that doesn't actually store the plain text password in the database
