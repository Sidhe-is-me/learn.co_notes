  Helper Methods
    Helper methods are methods that are written in the controller and are accessible in the views and provide some logical support.
    It is important to note that helper methods can be used for a lot more than just tracking whether a user is logged in and who the current user is. Helpers are methods that make it cleaner to add logic to our views.
